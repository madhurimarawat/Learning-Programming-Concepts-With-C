--> C is a general-purpose programming language.<br><br>
--> It is Procedural Programming language.<br><br>
--> It has been used to develop operating systems, databases and applications.<br><br>
--> It is Middle Level Programming language and gives more control to Programmer.

# Mode of Execution used <img src="https://logodix.com/logo/1709678.png" height=30px width=30px>
<h2>GCC Compiler</h2>
--> GCC stands for GNU C/C++ Compiler.<br><br>
--> To begin with GCC, visit the official website &nbsp;<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/"><img src="https://logodix.com/logo/1709678.png" height=30px width=30px></a><br><br>
--> Download GCC according to the platform being used like Linux, MacOs or Windows.<br><br>
--> Follow the setup wizard.<br><br>
--> Write c code in any text editor or IDE and save it with .c extention.<br><br>
--> Then just open the console and run this command -<br><br>

```
gcc filename.c -o Output
```
--> Filename is the name of the C script file and Output is the name of the output file.<br><br>
--> After this command is executed, if the code is successfully compiled output file will be saved in the same location as the code file.<br><br>
--> Once this Output file is executed in command prompt, the output will be displayed.

<h1>1.Primary Data Types</h1>
Primitive data types are the most basic data types that are used for representing simple values such as integers, float, characters, etc.<br>
<h2>i) Integer </h2>
--> The integer datatype in C is used to store the whole numbers without decimal values.<br><br>
--> Octal values, hexadecimal values, and decimal values can be stored in int data type in C. <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Range:  -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</li>
<li>Size: 4 bytes</li>
<li>Format Specifier: %d</li></ul>

<h2>ii) Float </h2>
--> In C programming float data type is used to store floating-point values.<br><br> 
--> Float in C is used to store decimal and exponential values.<br><br>
--> It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with single precision.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Range: 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38</li>
<li>Size: 4 bytes</li>
<li>Format Specifier: %f</li>
</ul>
<h2>iii) Character</h2>
--> Character data type allows its variable to store only a single character.<br><br>
--> The size of the character is 1 byte. It is the most basic data type in C.<br><br>
--> It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Range: (-128 to 127) or (0 to 255)</li>
<li>Size: 1 byte</li>
<li>Format Specifier: %c</li></ul>

<h1>2. Void</h1>
--> The void data type in C is used to specify that no value is present.<br><br>
--> It does not provide a result value to its caller.<br><br>
--> It has no values and no operations.<br><br>
--> It is used to represent nothing. Void is used in multiple ways as function return type, function arguments as void, and pointers to void.<br><br>

<h1>3. Enumerated Type</h1>
--> In computer programming, an enumerated type (also called enumeration) is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type.<br><br>
--> The enumerator names are usually identifiers that behave as constants in the language.<br><br>

<h2>i) Enum</h2>
--> Enumeration (or enum) is a user defined data type in C. It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, the names make a program easy to read and maintain.<br><br>
--> The keyword â€˜enumâ€™ is used to declare new enumeration types in C.<br>

<h1>4. Derived Data Types </h1>
The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.

<h2>i) Array</h2>
--> An array in C is a fixed-size collection of similar data items stored in contiguous memory locations.<br><br>
--> It can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, char, float, etc., and also derived and user-defined data types such as pointers, structures, etc.<br>
<h2>ii) Pointer</h2>
--> Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses.<br><br>
--> They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures.<br><br>
--> Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. <br>
<h2>iii) Structure</h2>
--> The structure in C is a user-defined data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.<br><br>
--> The struct keyword is used to define the structure in the C programming language. <br><br>
--> The items in the structure are called its member and they can be of any valid data type.<br>
<h2>iv) Union</h2>
--> A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location.<br><br>
--> Union can be defined with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time.<br><br>
--> Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.<br>
